            <h2>My Projects</h2>
             <p>The Philippines has a deep and diverse history from the earliest archipelago at least 709,00 years ago. Negrito were the first inhabitants to settle in the prehistoric age.
              Pre-Colonial Period: The islands were occupied with independent barangays or small communities governed by local chieftains called datus before foreign colonization. Trade with China, India, and other Southeast Asian kingdoms was prosperous.  

              Spanish Colonization (1521-1898): The beginning of Spanish interest was signified by Ferdinand Magellan's arrival in 1521. Official colonization of the islands happened in 1565 when they were named as Las Islas Filipinas, after the then king of Spain, Philip II. Under Spanish rule the islands were exposed to new infrastructure, a centralized government, Christianity, and other melting pot policies, however it also led to revolts.  

              Philippine Revolution & American Period (1896-1946): A national revolution started in 1896. Following the Spanish American War in 1898, Spain was defeated and cede the islands to the US in the Treaty of Paris. Filipinos declared independence after gaining support from other countries but control was established by the US in the Philippine-American War (1899-1902). With American control came the introduction of public education and democratic institutions.  

              Japanese Occupation (1942-1945): During WWII, the Philippines came under the Japanese rule. A strong resistance, combined with the return of Allied forces in 1945, led to liberation.  

              Modern Era and Independence: Full independence from the US was granted July 4, 1946. Since acquiring independence, the Philippines has undergone various political changes, such as Marcos's Martial Law (1972-1986).</p>
